# Links-to-NodeMCU

In this repository i have added some of the links to the websites which may help us to know more about NodeMCU.

You can find different communication protocols to connect 2 devices, be it an Arduino UNO or NodeMCU.

There are 3 different communication protocols through which NodeMCU (ESP8266, ESP32, etc) can communicate to the second device that may be a NodeMCU(ESP8266, ESP32)/ Arduino UNO/ Arduino Nano.
1. I2C- Only 2 wires are used, this protocol is mostly used.
2. SPI- 4 wires are used.
3. UART- 2 wires are used to connect Rx and Tx of NodeMCU to Rx and Tx of Arduino UNO.
