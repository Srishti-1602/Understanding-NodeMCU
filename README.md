# Links-to-NodeMCU

In this repository I have added some of the links to the websites which may help you to know more about NodeMCU, these are some very good websites explaining all the protocols you want to use and helping you with other stuff.

You can find different communication protocols to connect 2 devices, be it an Arduino UNO or NodeMCU.

There are 3 different communication protocols through which NodeMCU (ESP8266, ESP32, etc) can communicate to the second device that may be a NodeMCU(ESP8266, ESP32)/ Arduino UNO/ Arduino Nano.
1. I2C- Only 2 wires are used, this protocol is mostly used.
2. SPI- 4 wires are used.
3. UART- 2 wires are used to connect Rx and Tx of NodeMCU to Rx and Tx of Arduino UNO respectively.
